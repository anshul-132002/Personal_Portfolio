        <h2>FRONT END Developer</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Anshul Shrivas , an Aspiring software engineer who is currently working towards a Bachelor of
          Technology Degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

          Throughout my academic journey, I've gained expertise in programming languages like Java, and I'm passionate
          about exploring new technologies and developing innovative solutions. I strive to approach problems with a
          creative and analytical mindset, and I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals.

          Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to kickstart my career in the field of software development or Testing,
          where I can utilize my skills and contribute to the success of an organization.

          During my time as a student, I also participated in various coding competitions , where I sharpened my
          problem-solving skills and learned to work under pressure.

          I'm a quick learner and a self-starter, and I'm always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow. Outside of
          Academics, I enjoy playing Vollyball.
